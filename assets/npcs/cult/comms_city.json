  "We are the decendents of the ancient City of Obsidian. We got cut off from the city when the engine broke. We've been trying to find the city for generations.",
  "We have been going on expeditions to find the Obsidian City. I mean, I havent. But we have been doing our best to rediscover our ancient home.",
  "I heard from my dad that the City of Obsidian is covered in gold, and jems, and all sorts of treasure. Not that that's why I want to find it though.",
  "Its really good of the guild to help us search for Obsidian. I know its hard work, but I know it'll pay off in the end.",
  "My uncle said he saw the Obsidian City once. Mind you I was a kid at the time. He was probably just telling stories, but it would be nice anyhow."
