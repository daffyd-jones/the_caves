  "The members of the Obsidian Church are the decendents of the original Obsidians. Our ancestors were outside the city when it was lost, and couldn't get back.",
  "We have been doing our best to restore the caves. We believe that the only way to restore the caves is to perform our ancient rituals to calm the walls",
  "I dont know if you have seen any of the rituals that we are doing to restore the caves. They're not exaclty private, but we prefer to not be interrupted",
  "We like to keep records of the welfare of the settlements down here. Some of them were started by us Obsidians, but others were started by explorers and the guild.",
  "I have been anything I can about the ways of the original Obsidians. There's so much that was lost that needs to be rediscovered. Maybe we can fix the caves if we do.",
  "We have been doing everything we can to restore the caves. We're the only ones with the knowledge to do it. I can't be specific, it our secret history."
