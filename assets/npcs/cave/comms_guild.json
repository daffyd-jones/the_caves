  "Have you checked out the guild? They have some pretty cool stuff going on. They have postings for cool things people have found.",
  "The guild has been doing repairs on the caves, it seems to be kinda working. It's hard when the walls are shifting constantly.",
  "I don't know why the guild is doing repairs on the caves. The walls keep shifting, so they cant really do much. Also, wouldnt that make it a maze again?",
  "The guild has really done a lot down here, they have a clinic, and postings of cool stuff. They also have logs if you want to find people.",
  "It seems like there's more tension between the guild and the cultists. The guild's been doing repairs on the caves, and helping the Church find Obsidian.",
  "I saw the guild had a new posting about a ruin near by, Im gonna go check it out! If want to find ruins and stuff, check out the postings at the guild.",
  "The guild has been doing more and more down here, they've really helped people settle down here. I hope the Obsidian guys dont mind."
