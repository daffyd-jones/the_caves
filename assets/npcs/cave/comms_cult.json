  "Have you heard about that Obsidian Church that worships the caves? They do rituals and stuff, by brother saw them. So freaky!",
  "Those culty guys aren't so bad, they help out and do stuff for the community down here. I can see why they freak people out though.",
  "Apparently those Church guys are the decendents of the Obsidians. They have been down here trying to find their city for generations.",
  "If you need to find any information about nearby settlements, you should check out the Churches that around. They keep records of those things.",
  "My brother's friend saw some of those Obsidian guys carrying around lumpy sacks. I wonder what they're up to.",
  "The Obsidian cultists have been looking around for their lost city for years. I'm sure it's gone at this point. Oh well.",
  "I'm not sure why the guild is helping those Church guys find their city, maybe they have a deal going on. Maybe they get loot from the city."
