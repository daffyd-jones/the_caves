  "Have you heard of Obsidian? It's a city that's somewhere here in the caves. Theres people looking for it, but I'm just looking for mushrooms",
  "Are you looking for The Lost City at all? My cousin went looking for it, haven't heard from him in a while.",
  "They say the Obsidian City is covered in jewels that they mined out of the caves. I've been trying to find some, but I've just found some pretty rocks.",
  "People dont know much about the lost city, except that they built the shifting labrynth. I've heard that they got stuck in their city and couldnt get out. Horrible.",
  "There where a few Obsidians that were left in the caves when the city was lost. Apparently, that's where the Cave worshipers come from.",
  "The members of that cult are looking through the caves trying to find the city. Not sure if they are gonna find it, but they might someday."
