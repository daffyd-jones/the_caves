# History of the caves


The Obsidians lived deep in the caves and prospered in the safety of the caverns. They were a technologically advanced civilization that used their abilities to turn the vast caves into an ever shifting maze system. They created a technological consciousness to govern the maze and protect their city.

For years this worked well. The people treated their created Entity with care, and it protected, and gave them safe passage through the ever shifting maze behind which the city hid. But there were some among the Obsidians that had less care for the consciousness.

There was a small faction of the city's governance that attempted to use the Entity to control the city, and it's populace, in an attempt to gain more power. This caused portions of the Entity's programming, which had not been created for this purpose, to conflict and cause errors and crashes throughout its system.

The Obsidians lost control of the Entity, and through it the maze. The maze walls began shifting wildly, before closing off the city from the caves. The maze walls continued to shift, but they were no longer under anyone's control.The Obsidion City was lost, and the Obsidian's that were outside the city at the time, were abandoned in the caves.

They became cut off from each other, their history, and cultural knowledge. But some found each other and persisted and grew despite this. Over time, they developed their own cultural history from bits of remembered lore from their ancestors, fragmented and shaped by time. The gaps in knowledge became filled with legend and spiritualism, losing more foundation through the years.

During the time when the Entity began crashing, and the caves were moving wildly, some of the group that misused it escaped the city. Most of them died while escaping the city, crushed by the walls as they smashed into each other. Some however made their way into the caves. They formed a small settlement and moved on with their life.

The descendants of this settlement grew up not knowing of their origins, as their parents hid their betrayal out of shame. However, one of the sons of the original traitors came across a piece of Obsidian technology. In a dusty room one day, the son found a compass that the Obsidians had used to navigate the caves more easily.

While the compass was in many ways a mystery, the young man figured out that the compass pointed towards a generator running at a specific frequency. After some experimenting, he found that he could tune the compass to point to generators running at different speeds. He figured this could be used to navigate the caves by placing generators running at different speeds in settlements.

The man used the original compass as inspiration to create a new one. The new compass was more simple and excluded the components, and ports that they didn't understand. It had a simple compass face, and a control for tuning the compass to the desired frequency. He then created a simple generator that could be reliably tuned to specific frequencies. The generators became known as Anchors.

The young man began moving from settlement to settlement, sharing the new technology. He shared the designs and talked to who he could, but it was a large task to undertake. Eventually, he and some others who believed in the cause formed The Guild. Over time, they began to call him The Tinkerer. He continued to work to expand the use of the anchors, and with them collectivize the settlements through the Guild.

Over the years, and after The Tinkerer's death, The Guild grew to be a system that connected the settlements. They provided services that facilitated trade, provided health services, and protection for the settlements and those in the caves. They also assist with chaperoning and outfitting search expeditions in the caves.

The Guild works in conjunction with the Obsidians to oversee the caves. The two groups form a loose form of government, though no official board exists. As The Guild grew, so did the Obsidians from the original remnants lost in the caves, cut off from the Obsidian City. The expansion of The Guild, and the use of the Anchors, was supported by the Obsidians who used them to find those of them that were separated. 

Now largely collectivized, the Obsidians search for their lost city, and the engine that would allow them to reveal it. The Guild assists with the search, providing gear, and chaperones to protect the exploration parties. Some Guild members take part out of a passion to uncover the past, others for relics, others simply for the work.

The work is dangerous, and it is not uncommon for parties to go missing or members to be lost. The search for the engine has been going on for decades, and the lack of progress has been taking a toll on both parties. While some remain faithful, others begin to question whether the endeavour is worth the resources, or even possible. The wear has inflamed tensions between the two groups, with fights breaking out between their members.

In addition to tensions over the ongoing search, there is resentment growing over the efforts taken the restore the caves. The Guild has ventured to take on a construction campaign throughout the caves. They have begun construction on the cave walls, focusing on repairing the broken walls and parts that don't seem to work right. They hope that the maintenance will allow the cave to move properly, and that through working on the maze they can learn how to control it without the engine.

The Obsidians meanwhile have been attempting to heal the caves using monthly rituals. The rituals are intended to sooth or appease the spirit that they believe resides in the caves. They do this not knowing that the Entity is a technological consciousness, rather than a spirit as they believe. They hope that performing these rituals according to their fragmented lore will restore the caves, or reveal the way to the engine.

The Guild grows increasingly frustrated by this, in addition to the tensions over expeditions. They don't see the rituals as being productive, especially as they expend resources on repairs. However, what they don't know is that while the rituals are misguided, the repairs are just as futile. The only way to restore order and give closure to the people in the caves, is to find the engine, and heal the Entity that resides within.

It is amidst this that the player enters their world. They descend the ladder from the surface, in search of adventure, and will find that they have the means to give them the closure that they need.
