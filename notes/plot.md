- _The Cult is attempting to restore the caves by performing rituals and searching for engine/city_:
  - The Cult hopes performing the rituals will appease, sooth, restore the conscious engine and the caves
  - The Cult has become far removed from their origins, and dont know how the engine works

- _The Guild doesnt know that the engine is conscious_:
  - The rituals are performed by the cult in an attempt to sooth/heal/contact/restore the cave consciousness
  - The Cult thinks that other than finding the engine, that this is the only way to restore the caves
- While the leaders of both factions want to find common ground, resentment grows among their members
