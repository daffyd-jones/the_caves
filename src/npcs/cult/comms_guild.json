  "The guild has been helping us search for the lost engine and our city. It's quite good of them, I dont think we'd survive the monsters otherwise.",
  "I saw that the guild has been doing repairs on the cave walls, like restoring walls and stuff. That's nice of them, though I'm not sure how much it will help.",
  "I've noticed some of the guild members have been giving me the cold shoulder recently. I greeted one earlier today, and they brushed me off like I'd done something.",
  "Those guild guys are alright, but I've noticed that some of them are rather grumpy. Maybe there's something going on, who knows?",
  "The guild was formed a few decades ago by explorers that had settled down here. We dont mind, theres more than enough cave it seems."
