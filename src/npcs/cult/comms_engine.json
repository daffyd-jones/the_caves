  "We have been searching for the engine for generations. We haven't found it yet, but im sure we'll find it soon.",
  "We hope that when we find the engine, that we will also find the Obsidian City. The engine moved the cave walls to keep the city hidden, so it should be there.",
  "The engine was used by our ancestors to keep their city safe. Then one day it malfunctioned and caused the walls to move randomly. We dont know why.",
  "I am leaving next week to go looking for the Obsidian Engine. There's an official search expedition going next month, but I'm gonna try  it alone.",
  "I've spent the last year studying all the relics we have to learn how the Obsidian Engine works. I think I almost have it, then I can heal the caves"
